## Game Dev and Design

- Concept: A gothic platform game reinterpreting the classic Orpheo and Euridice Myth

## Final Game idea
 - An endless level. Orpheo hopes to reach the underworld, but it is impossible. He must find a way to deal with the grieve of losing Euridice, no way around it. 
 - Orpheo must jump between platforms to avoid chasms and bombs while grabbing as most coins as possible.
